The dataset contains advertising spend across three media channels (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the corresponding product sales. For this analysis, we focus on:

Feature: TV advertising spend
Target: Sales

## Objective
The primary goal is to:

Understand the implementation of Simple Linear Regression.
Compare the results and interpretability of models built using Statsmodels and Scikit-Learn.
Analyze the relationship between TV advertising spend and Sales.

## Tools and Libraries Used
    Python Libraries:
      pandas for data manipulation.
      matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
      statsmodels for detailed regression analysis and statistical insights.
      scikit-learn for building predictive models and evaluating performance.
    Environment:
      Jupyter Notebook
